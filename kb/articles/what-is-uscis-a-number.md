# What is USCIS A-Number (Alien Registration Number) and where can I find it?

An Alien Registration Number ("A-Number", "Alien Number" or "USCIS Number") is a 8 to 9 digit number that USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) uses to identify immigrants who apply permanent residency in the United States. Y

On permanent resident card (green card), you can find Alien Registration Number on the front side. It is also embedded within the characters on the backside of card as well. The A-Number is listed in format “A000-000-000”, your A-Number is the letter “A” followed by 8 or 9 numbers (such as A012345678). USCIS uses A-Number to track immigration files. It is very important number and every immigrant individual gets this number.

You can find your A-Number on below listed documents:
- Permanent Resident Green Card
- Employment Authorization Document.
- Immigrant Visa. 
- I-485 Receipt or approval notice
- I-131 receipt or approval notice
- I-140 receipt or approval notice
- H1B Receipt Notice (some cases)
- I-797C Notice of Action (some cases)
- Immigrant Fee Handout

## How do I get an Alien Registration Number (A-Number)?
You don't need to do anything to get A-number. USCIS assigns an A-Number to all immigrants who apply for Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) or immigrant visa. 

### A-Number on a Green Card
If your Green card is issued after May 10, 2010, then your Alien Registration Number (A-Number) is the same as your nine-digit USCIS# marked in this example:

### A-Number on a old Green Card

If your Green Card is issued between 2004 and May 10, 2010, then your Alien Registration Number (A-Number) will appear on your card as shown below:

### A-Number on Immigrant Data Summary
If green card is applied through consular processing (applied for green card at a U.S. embassy or consulate), then it will be on Data Summary stapled to the front of your immigrant visa package. You can find A-Number at the top of the Immigrant Data Summary.

### A-number on H1B Receipt Notice
Normally, the A-Number is not listed on an H-1B receipt notice or approval notice. However, if your employer files H-1B visa for you (typically H-1B extension) after your I-140 is already approved, the receipt notice will have the A-Number.
It will be listed under the “BENFICIARY” column, where it will have both your A-Number as well as your name.
In such a case, the H-4 visa receipt notice will still not have an A-Number.
