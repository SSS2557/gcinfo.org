<summary>Which is a better option, AOS EAD, H4 EAD or H1B?</summary>
It depends on your situation. Here are pros and cons.
- AOS EAD: Easy to renew but once you filed for the extension and EAD is not renewed within 180 days then you have to stop working until USCIS approves EAD.
- H4 EAD: Easy to renew but once EAD expires then you cannot work even if you filed extension. There is no 180 days grace period like AOS EAD.
- H1B: Easy to renew and there is no risk. In case H1B gets rejected you can switch to AOS EAD.
