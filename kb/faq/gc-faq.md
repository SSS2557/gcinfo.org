<summary>Which is a better option, AOS EAD, H4 EAD or H1B?</summary>
<p>It depends on your situation. Here are pros and cons.
<ul>  
<li>AOS EAD: Easy to renew. You can work 180 days after filing extension. Once you filed extension and EAD is not renewed within 180 days then you have to stop working until USCIS approves EAD.</li>
<li>H4 EAD: Easy to renew. You can work 180 days after filing extension but only if I-94 is valid.</li>
<li>H1B: Easy to renew and there is no risk. In case H1B gets rejected, then you can switch to AOS EAD.</li>    
<ul>  </p>
