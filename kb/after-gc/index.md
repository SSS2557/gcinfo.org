# After Green Card

After receiving original green card, make sure to do the following:
 
- <b>Review green card:</b> Ensure your name, <a href="/kb/gc/gc-category-codes">GC category code</a> and <a href="/kb/articles/what-is-uscis-a-number">A-Number</a> is correct. The A# is identified on the I-485 Approval notice or Receipt notice. Also make sure your complete name is on the back side of the card.
- <b>Obtain an unrestricted Social Security Card (SSN):</b> You will need to notify the SSA that you are now a green card holder.  The SSA will issue a new card (the same number applies). See ssa site for more <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10515.pdf">instructions and information</a>.
- Review <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/guides/M-618.pdf">guide for New Immigrants</a> as well as visit the USCIS website for further <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-we-grant-your-green-card">information related to your permanent residence status</a>.
- <b>Notify USCIS Change of Address:</b> You need to notify USCIS if there is change of address by completing and submitting <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/coa/">form AR-11</a>. United States immigration law and regulations require all non-U.S. citizens (including those in visa status, pending AOS applicants or Permanent Residents, as applicable,) to notify the U.S. Department of Homeland Security of changes of address within <b>10 days</b> of such change. Compliance with the requirement to notify the USCIS of any address changes is also a condition of your stay in the United States.

<strong>Penalty:</strong> Failure to comply with the address change notification requirements may affect your (You (or parent or legal guardian of an alien under age 14 who is required to give notice)) ability to remain in the United States and your ability to reenter the United States after travel abroad; noncompliance may also be criminally punishable as a misdemeanor, with a fine not to exceed $200 and/or imprisonment of not more than 30 days or both. <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title8-section1306&num=0&edition=prelim">Ref</a>
