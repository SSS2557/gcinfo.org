# After Green Card

After receiving original green card, make sure to do the following:
 
- Review green card to ensure your name, <a href="/kb/gc/gc-category-codes">GC category code</a> and <a href="/kb/articles/what-is-uscis-a-number">A-Number</a> is correct. The A# is identified on the I-485 Approval notice or Receipt notice. Also make sure your complete name is on the back side of the card.
- Obtain an unrestricted Social Security Card (SSN). You will need to notify the SSA that you are now a green card holder.  The SSA will issue a new card (the same number applies). See ssa site for more <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10515.pdf">instructions and information</a>.
- Review <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/guides/M-618.pdf">guide for New Immigrants</a> as well as visit the USCIS website for further <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-we-grant-your-green-card">information related to your permanent residence status</a>.
- Change of Address, You need to notify USCIS if there is change of address by completing and submitting <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/coa/">form AR-11</a>. United States immigration law and regulations require all non-U.S. citizens (including those in visa status, pending AOS applicants or Permanent Residents, as applicable,) to notify the U.S. Department of Homeland Security of changes of address within 10 days of such change.
- Apply for Global Entry, Global Entry is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival in the United States, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry">more details</a>.
