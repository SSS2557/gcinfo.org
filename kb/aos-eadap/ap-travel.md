<p>Travelers using an advance parole document to enter the U.S. may be taken into secondary inspection, where an officer will confirm that s/he has an adjustment of status application pending.

<details>
<summary>Will I be issued a new I-94 when I re-enter the U.S. using an AP document?</summary>
<p>Yes. When you re-enter the U.S. pursuant to a valid AP document, you will be issued a new I-94 card in either paper or electronic format.  If entering the U.S. through an air or seaport, you will be provided with an annotated stamp in your passport and you will be directed to download a copy of your I-94 at http://www.cbp.gov/i94. If you are entering the U.S. via a land port of entry, you will continue to be issued a paper I-94 card. You will be paroled into the U.S. for a period of up to one year. Thus, your I-94 card will only be valid for a period not to exceed one year from the date of your entry into the U.S.  Note that this I-94 expiration date is not relevant for status purposes or AP document validity purposes.  Please see the next section regarding maintenance of status while an adjustment of status application is pending with the USCIS. <a href="https://www.larrabee.com/immigration-law-faqs/advance-parole-travel-document/">ref</a>
