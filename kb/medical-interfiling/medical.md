# Getting I-693 Medical Exams Done

Completing I-693 Medical Exam takes anywhere between 1 week to 2/3 weeks. It totally depends on how much you go prepared to visit doctor. Your medical may not complete in one visit, it may take 2-3 visit to the doctor, so be prepared. In the first visit, the doctor will take a blood sample and next visit, they may discuss reports with you. The exam must be done by a doctor who is authorized by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Your regular doctor cannot do this.
