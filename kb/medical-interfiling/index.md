# Interfiling Medical Exams for I-485 Process


## What is Medical Interfiling? 
Interfiling medical (form I-693) is a process where I-485 pending applicant can [send medical reports to USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8-part-b-chapter-4) before they send RFE. In most cases USCIS will accept the interfile, but it is not 100% guaranteed. USCIS may send RFE requesting for medical reports even after interfiling or request you to bring at the time of in-person interview. In such case, you must get another sealed medical report and provide to them.

#### Remember
- If you are thinking to interfile medical then it is recommended to get two copies of sealed medical reports from civil surgeon. One use for interfiling and other in case if they send RFE.
- After interfiling, it is not advised to chat with Emma or call USCIS for checking interfiling status. They may not be able to answer you, so don't get stressed out by calling or chatting with them.

## Timing of I-693 Submission 
[As per USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8-part-b-chapter-4), Applicants may submit the Form I-693 medical examination report to USCIS:
- Concurrently with the immigration benefit application; or
- <font color=green>At any time after filing the immigration benefit application but before USCIS finalizes adjudication of that application.</font> If not submitted simultaneously with the immigration benefit application, applicants may bring the medical examination report to an interview or wait until USCIS issues an RFE requesting the medical examination report.

## Filing Process
- Complete medical and get sealed I-693 Medical Reports signed by the Civil Surgeon 
  - You need to send reports within 60 days to USCIS if you are filing with I-485. 
  - If you already filed I-485 then you can send within 2 year, 60 days rule don't apply here. See USCIS table on [this page](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8-part-b-chapter-4). Also see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0CIiX11Qrw) by immigration attorney Reddy.
  - Try to get two sealed I-693 Medical Reports signed by the Civil Surgeon, they may charge you some fees. One you can use for interfiling and other you can use in case if you get RFE. 
- Attach below required documents
- Send packet to USCIS. 
  - Use single packet for primary and derivative.
  - On USPS/FedEx/UPS envelope put Attn:I 693 medical interfile
  - Address should be what you have on your I485, if Emma gave you a non PO number, that is ok too, they both go to same location. (This is not applicable unless your application is transferred to another service center, in that case, go with what Emma tells you)
  - Sent using USPS if address is PO Box, use fedex/USPS if not a PO Box

**Notes:**

## How to Arrange Packet Documents

#### for Primary and Derivative(spouse/son/daughter)
1. Cover letter (it can be with or without barcodes, both works. Keep it simple. You can use one cover letter for all or individual, anything is fine) 
2. Barcodes page (this is optional)
3. Copy of I-797C, Notice of Action, Receipt of filing I-485
4. Copy of biometrics receipt (if your biometrics status is not updated)
5. Copy of driver's license (specify state) or copy of passport (This is not required for derivative applicants if you are sending together. Add only for Primary applicant)
6. Copy of COVID-19 vaccination record (if you have, but this will be mandatory after Oct-01-2021)
7. Sealed I-693 Medical Reports signed by the Civil Surgeon (Don't tamper envelope by writing or sticking anything on it. USCIS don't accept tampered envelope)
8. Put primary and derivative medical reports in a single envelope. (if cases are at different location then send them separately)

Don't staple documents, **use [binder clips](https://amzn.to/3AtPzKZ) (smallest 0.6-inch clip) or [paper clips](https://amzn.to/3zp3n8h).**

## USCIS Interfiling Addresses 
1. Highly recommend sending with FedEx/UPS/Courier since they usually guarantee the delivery time, and you can refund if they missed it.
2. Send to the service center that is on your latest I-485 letter (especially if you receive a case transfer). Unless you know for a fact that your case is at the local field office. (From Emma, lawyer communication, etc)
3. Use the table below to match the service center to their address. The P.O. box addresses are just for USPS (the blue logo one, not UPS which has a brown logo).

## Interfiling FAQ

<details open>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where I should send I-485 interfiling documents?</summary>
<p>You should send to the address mentioned on your I-485 receipt. If address is PO Box then you can only use USPS.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I interfiled medical but now received RFE for medical, what should I do?</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>How I will know if my medical is attached to my case or not?</summary>
<p>You may check by using EMMA chat or call USCIS. Contact number: +1-800-375-5283 and just say “infopass” to speak to an agent.</p>
